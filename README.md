# Machine-Learning-Tasks
A vision system is being built to automate the distribution of mails by employing drones to carry the box and deliver it to the correct destination.  For this, the drone should be able to perform in this system by identifying house numbers. For this, a model is created that can distinguish house numbers and connect them to the number on the package's delivery address, which focuses primarily on number recognition. As a result, models are constructed and tested using format two on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, which is more straightforward than the other. Convolution Neural Network model is built concentrating on simplicity and accuracy when it comes to number identification. Finally, the models are compared by running a few experiments with different CNN architectures, adjusting epochs, parameters, and optimizers.
